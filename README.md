# Thesis
CryptoNote white paper over MPC


# How to run
Have MP-SPDZ library and this git repository in same folder e.g:
ls example\_folder -> MP-SDPZ, Thesis, rest

To make things easier in the Thesis folder. Run the command "source ./make.sh".
This sets up two aliases, which should only be used in the Thesis folder. If you write the command "run" then it executes "RSIG.x" in the MP-SPDZ folder.
If you write the command "mk" it runs the makefile in the MP-SPDZ folder.
