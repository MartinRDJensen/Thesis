# Thesis
CryptoNote white paper over MPC

# How to run
Have MP-SPDZ library and this git repository in same folder e.g:
ls example\_folder -> MP-SDPZ, Thesis, rest

To make things easier in the Thesis folder. Run the command "source ./make.sh".
This sets up aliases that we have used throughout the project. The most relevanvt being 'mk' and it should only be executed when in the Thesis folder.
If you write the command "mk" it runs the makefile in the MP-SPDZ folder.
